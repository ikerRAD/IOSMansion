Hello player! As you can see, everything is dark, such a nice party you had last night! ;)
You may be wondering who am I. I'm Jessica, 3 years ago I woke up here, and I couldn't get 
out of this place because I ran out of oxygen, so now I'm a ghost that will help you escape not to end up like me.

Do you want to know where you are? Say "pwd".
->pwd
As you can see "????" appeared. That´s where you are. Remember this magical word, which will reveal where your are each time you say it.
Well, you have to get out of here quickly! You need to say something in order to escape. Another magical word!
This one is ls, try it!

->ls
As you can see, the information is messy , and it´s not enough! Try to say "ls -l" to solve this problem.
->ls -l
Much better! Can you see the key? Try to read it with "cat key" 
->cat key
//cd//
Fantastic! It is teaching you how to get out using a new magical word, cd! C´mon, follow what it says. Every time you whant to remember it say cat door.
->cd .. (nowhere)

Hello again ! Do you know where you are? Remember the magical word!
-> pwd 
Exactly, you are nowhere! When you need to pass from one room to another, you will appear here. In order to follow your escape adventure, keep saying the magical words!


From now on, when you enter a room, TALK TO ME FIRST (using cat), I do not trust you...
