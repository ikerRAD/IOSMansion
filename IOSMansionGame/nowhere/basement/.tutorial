Hello player! As you can see, everything is dark, such a nice party you had last night! ;)
You may be wondering who am I. I'm Jessica, 3 years ago I woke up here, and I couldn't get 
out of this place because I ran out of oxygen, so now I'm a ghost that will help you escape not to end up like me.

Do you want to know where you are? Say "pwd".
->pwd
As you can see "????" appeared. That´s where you are. Remember this magical word, which will reveal where your are each time you say it.
Well, you have to get out of here quickly! You need to say something in order to escape. Another magical word!
This one is ls, try it!

->ls
As you can see, the information is messy , and it´s not enough! Try to say "ls -l" to solve this problem.
->ls -l
Much better! As you can observe, some strange letters have appeared. Those are file permissions, we have some rules in this house! apart from the
permissions you should see a d in the leftmost part (sometimes), those d's mean that the name related to it is a new location. Can you see the key?
Try to read it with "cat key" 

But firstly I have to tell you that it will teach you how to get out using a new magical word, cd! C´mon, follow what it says. Every time you want to remember it say "cat Key".

->cat key

->cd .. (nowhere)
//cd//
