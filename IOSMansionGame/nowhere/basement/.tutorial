Hello player! As you can see, everything is dark, such a nice party you had last night! ;)
You may be wondering who am I. I'm Jessica, 3 years ago I woke up here, and I couldn't get 
out of this place because I ran out of oxygen, so now I'm a ghost that will help you escape not to end up like me.

Do you want to know where you are? Say "pwd".
->pwd
Exactly, you are in a dark basement. Remember this magical word, which will reveal where you are each time you say it.
Well, you have to get out of here quickly! You need to say something in order to escape. Another magical word!
This one is ls. It is like a scanner of the room, it lists you everything you are able to see, locations and objects. Try it!

->ls
As you can see, the information is too brief and it´s not enough! Try to say "ls -l" to solve this problem.
->ls -l
Much better! As you can observe, some strange letters have appeared. Those are file permissions, we have some rules in this house! Apart from the
permissions you should see a d in the leftmost part of some of the components, those d's mean that the name related to it is a new location. 
If a name is missing that d, it means that it is an object. Can you see the key?

Try to read it with "cat key". It will show you everything inside an object, just like reading a book!

But firstly I have to tell you that the key will teach you how to get out using a new magical word, cd! This enables you to move around. 
If you say cd followed by a location that appears in the ls list, you will enter on it. If you say cd .., you will go back to the previous location.
C´mon, follow what it says. Every time you want to remember it say "cat Key".

->cat key

->cd .. (nowhere)
