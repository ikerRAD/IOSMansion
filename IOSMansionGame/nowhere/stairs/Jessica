You have made it to the stairs! Good job! To be honest, I didn't have any hope in you...

What about your memory? I bet you don't remember anything about yesterday...
This two new magical words will help you when you forget about something I have told you:



C'mon, is your ass that heavy? Or is it the hangover?
It's just stairs, hurry up!
