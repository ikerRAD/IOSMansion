You have made it to the stairs! Good job! To be honest, I didn't have any hope in you...

What about your memory? I bet you don't remember anything about yesterday...
This two new magical words will help you when you forget about something I have told you:

If you say "help", the list of magical words available in your current location will be listed.
If you want more specific information about a magical word instead, say "man" followed by the word. 
For example, "man pwd" will give you information about the pwd word.

That was all by now! So c'mon, is your ass that heavy? Or is it the hangover?
It's just stairs, hurry up!
