When was the last time you read a book? Oh, you don't remember it...
So we have a serious problem...
The piece of password of this room is hidden in one of these books, but there are really long!
Searching for it would take you years... And you need to escape as soon as possible!

OK, if you insist... I will help you.
The password is written in one of the books like this: password :xxxxxxx.
There is one magical word that will save you a lot of time, grep.
It is kind of a little elf that reads the whole book quickly for you, searchs for the string you have specified and 
if it finds it, it prints the whole line in which it has found it.
The way of saying it is: grep string_to_be_found file_to_search

So c'mon, let's start searching for the word "password" in these old dusty books!
