Well now you might be asking yourself why I told you to come here.
Look at your clothes, they look like shit, I think I can even see some vomit.

You MUST change your clothes, wear the ones inside this wardrobe.
To change your clothes, first you have to take off the dirty ones you have on.
To do so, you must create a new object named dirtyclothes using a new magical word, touch.
This magical word enables you to create objects and it works like this:
touch name_of_object

Once you are naked, you should put the newclothes on, unless you want to die of 
hypothermia and stay here with me forever :)
To wear them, removing them from the wardrobe will do the trick.
I suppose that by now you will know what that means... A new magical word!
In this case, the word you need to say to remove objects is rm, and it works similarly to touch.
You just need to say rm followed by the name of the object you want to remove.

Ah! Just in case that evil brain is planning to remove me... 
I am a ghost, I decide when to appear, so you won't get rid of me unless you escape! Hahahahaha

Once you have clean clothes on, lock this wardrobe with a password to avoid another 
drunkie stealing your old clothes in a crazy night as the one you had.
