Uhhh creepy!! All the dolls are missing the head.
Except that one in that corner. Looks like Annabelle...
Strange...
Very strange...
I swear yesterday all the dolls had their head and Anabelle was at the kitchen...
...

If I where you I wouldn't stand near Anabelle.
Well, nevermind.... I'm dead and nothing can kill me again.
So what if you look at the wardrobe and the library?
