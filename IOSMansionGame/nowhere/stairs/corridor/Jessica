This is a dark corridor...
uhhh scary!
Anyway, there are some doors.
But first look at that!!! The exit door.
The place that you are going to leave me.
Oh noo... It has a password. Great for me we are going to spend the infinty together.
Unless you find the password...
You know what? ghosts don't sleep but today I woke up in a good mood.
To get the password you need to complete the activities that are in each room.
Every room is going to give you an piece of the password.
Once completed try the different conbinations at the door until ones works.
