This is a dark corridor...
uhhh scary!
Anyway, there are some doors.
But first look at that!!! The exit door.
The place where you are going to leave me.
Oh noo... It has a password. Great for me we are going to spend the infinty together.
Unless you find the password...
You know what? Ghosts don't sleep but today I woke up in a good mood.
To get the password you need to complete the activities in every room.
When you complete one, you will get a piece of the password. Take note and don't forget them!
This is the order in which you have to visit the rooms: Bedroom, kitchen and bath.
I suppose you will follow my recommendations, but anyway, in case you are a busybody, you won't be able to enter somewhere you are not supposed to yet.
Once you have completed every activity, gather all password pieces together and try different combinations at the exit door until one works.
